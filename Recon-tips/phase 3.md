🚨 Phase 3: Behavioral + Payloadless Recon (The Silent Hunter Mode)

> Goal: Find bugs without payloads. Use psychology, infrastructure clues, and app behavior to detect misconfigs, secrets, and logic flaws.
Think like a ghost — no noise, just high signal.

🔬 1. Behavior Mapping Without Interaction

Even without hitting endpoints, you can:

Analyze JS + HTML structure

Check for framework-generated paths (e.g., /graphql, /api/health, /status, /v1/user/me)

Check CSP headers for hidden domains:

Content-Security-Policy: connect-src api.hidden.com auth.example.com


> These headers leak infrastructure structure. No payload needed.

🧠 2. Psychological Fingerprinting

Try to understand how devs think:

If you see this	Dev Mindset	Likely Vulnerability

/beta/, /v2/	Rapid prototyping	Misconfigs, test creds
x-dev-header, staging.js	Lazy environment switching	IDORs, hardcoded secrets
mobile.bundle.js	Native app logic	Token misuse, hardcoded secrets
window._env_	Client exposes config	Keys, bucket names



---

🧵 3. Changelog + Dev Log Recon (Deadly Accurate)

Look for:

/changelog, /releases, /version, /logs

GitHub changelogs:

site:github.com intitle:"target" inurl:changelog.md


Why?
Changelogs reveal:

Feature rollouts ("Added Single Sign-On")

Infra migrations ("Moved to Firebase")

API changes ("Deprecated /v1/user/login")


Now you know where to hit.

🌐 4. SNI-based Discovery (Cloud Recon Elite Trick)

Try resolving subdomains via SNI (Server Name Indication) even if no DNS entry exists.

Tool:

sni-scan


How it helps:

You find cloud subdomains before DNS is live.

Detect WAF-free staging servers.

Works amazing with .cdn.shopify.com, *.webflow.io, Vercel, Render, Netlify, etc.



---

🧊 5. Payloadless SSRF/IDOR Detection

You don’t always need payloads. Try:

Visiting /me, /profile, /v1/self with different tokens or cookie mods

Look for different error codes (403 vs 200 vs 401)

Try basic user switching with ?id=2, ?account_id=next, etc.


Use behavior response as the signal.


---

🔎 6. Hidden DNS Clues + Signal Recon

Example: subdomain has .statuspage.io
→ Company is using Atlassian ecosystem
→ Try:

Jira endpoint scan: /rest/api/2/, /secure/Dashboard.jspa

Confluence fuzzing: /wiki/rest/api/space

Forgotten domains in TXT, CAA, MX records


Tools:

dnsx

crt.sh

chaos + shuffledns



---

📱 7. Silent Mobile Recon (From Frontend Only)

From just the mobile site or PWA:

Pull embedded JS files

Search for firebaseConfig, api_key, client_secret

Look at service workers for:

Caching rules

Auth checks

Offline data stores (can leak data paths)



> Bonus: Watch for push notifications setup — often linked to Firebase, can leak project info.




---

🧰 Toolset (Mobile-Ready)

Tool	Purpose

httpx, dnsx, naabu	Infra map without brute force
waymore, arjun, gauplus	Passive JS + param discovery
sni-scan, tlsx, asnmap	Passive SSL/TLS fingerprinting
linkfinder, getJS	JS recon, pure passive
gf + xurlfind3r	Pattern-based endpoint scanning

🧠 Mindset for Phase 3:

> Recon without payloads = True mastery.
You’re not making noise on the server. You’re watching, thinking, and seeing what the app tells you by its nature.
